I'm Natalia Markelova, the founder of Einsteiners LLC, and I'm absolutely delighted to introduce myself as a party planner. My passion for events stems from the cherished family traditions of my upbringing, where we gathered for grand celebrations filled with love and joy. Kids birthdays, in particular, hold a special place in my heart as they mark a significant milestone in the lives of families. I truly empathize with the challenges and stress that many parents face during the planning process. Having navigated through the whirlwind of planning for my own kids, I understand firsthand the excitement and, at times, overwhelming nature of it all. It was this personal journey that inspired me to become a party planner to ensure that every kid experiences the fun and parents the ease of planning their dream day.
